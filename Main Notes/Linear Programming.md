## what is it
- Problem where you need the result of a **linear** _objective function_ on some variables, given _constraints_ on those variables
- Standard LP is in `P`, but Integer Linear Programming (**ILP**) is NP-Hard

## tools
- some tools can solve LP / ILP problems very fast, e.g.
- [z3-solver](https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/guide-examples.htm)
- [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/)
