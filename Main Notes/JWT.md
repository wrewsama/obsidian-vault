Generally used for authentication, not authorisation (i.e. it only makes sure that the curr user is the same user that logged in)

Components:

- Header: contains signing algo and type of token
- Payload: Contains the claims or JSON object
- Signature: String generated by the signing algo used to verify the integrity of JSON payload (applied on header, payload, and some secret(this secret ensures you cant fake the payload))

*Storing JWT in browser storage is susceptible to cross site scripting (XSS) attacks
