- Abstraction for a connection over some protocol
- Example: If host A connects to host B over TCP, it will send/receive messages from its socket, which will be identified with the quintuple $(IP_A, Port_A, IP_B, Port_B, TCP)$
- Other kinds of sockets
    - UDP sockets
    - Unix sockets: IPC within the same host
