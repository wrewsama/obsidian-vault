**Benefits**
- Simple services
- Team autonomy
- Fast deployment pipelines
	- independent deployments
	- fast testing
- Support multiple tech stacks
- Segregate subdomains by characteristics
- no single point of failure

**Drawbacks**
- distributed ops may be complex and difficult to understand and troubleshoot
- Distributed ops could potentially be inefficient
- some ops might need eventually consistent transactions
- some ops might involve tight runtime coupling between services, reducing availability
- tight design-time coupling between services requires time-consuming lockstep changes
