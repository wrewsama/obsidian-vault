JVM: Loads, verifies, and executes bytecode. Also has a JIT compiler that converts bytecode to machine-specific code.

JRE: Set of software tools responsible for execution of Java program. Includes deployment solutions, dev toolkits, & extra libraries

JDK: Contains tools required to compile, debug, and run a program developed using Java.

*note: all of them are platform dependent. The language & bytecode itself is platform independent

*note2: To just run, only JRE and JVM are needed
