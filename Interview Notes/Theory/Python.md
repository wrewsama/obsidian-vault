## == vs is

== checks for equal VALUE

is checks if 2 things are the same in memory

## Decorators

pattern that allows user to add new functionality to something without modifying its structure

implemented as a function that takes in a function and returns a wrapper on that function with extended functionality

## Dict/List comprehension

Syntactic sugar that lets us build mapped / filtered lists or dicts from a given iterable

## Pickling/ unpickling

Basically same idea as zipping and unzipping (compression + storage)

## Generators

Function that returns an iterable collection of items one at a time, without loading the whole collection into memory

## Execution

Actually pretty similar to java

1. compilation to bytecode (.pyc files in __pycache__)
2. at the same time...

1. interpreter
2. JIT compiler

## GIL

Global Interpreter Lock: mutex that allows only 1 thread to control Python interpreter
