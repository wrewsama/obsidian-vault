## B Trees

Properties:

- All leaves are @ the same level (perfectly balanced)
- All non root nodes must be at least half full (floor div by 2)
- For each node, no. of children = no. of keys + 1
- within the node, keys are in ascending order
- O(logn) search insert and delete
- all insertions happen at the leaf node

searches are basically the same idea as a normal ass binary search tree

Insert:

- search for the leaf node where the val should be inserted
- if node is full, split and promote the middle node
- do that recursively to the root

Delete:

- search for the node then delete it
- if that node is now too empty

- if sibling node has extra keys, rotate from that node
- else bring parent key down to replace the deleted key, then merge the node that is also a child of that key

- for internal node, just replace deleted val with an appropriate child val (max of left or min of right) then rebalance with the above steps

## Red Black Trees

Properties:

- each node is either red or black
- root and leaves(null) are black
- if node is red, then children are black
- all paths from node to leaf contain same number of black nodes

- longest path cannot be more than 2x length of shortest path (longest path will alternate red and black while shortest will have only black)

insertions:

- insert node and colour it red
- recolour and rotate nodes to fix violations. Do the following recursively:

- node is the root: colour it black
- node's uncle (parent's sibling lol) is red: recolour parent, uncle, and grandparent
- node's uncle is black

- node is near side (closer to uncle): rotate parent to far side
- node is far side: rotate grandparent to near side then recolour initial parent and grandparent

deletions:

- transplant(u, v) that handles reconnecting parent of deleted node with given child node
- delete has 3 cases

- one child null: note original colour, transplant, then fixup
- neither null: get min node in right subtree (successor), transplant that and its right child, set successor's right child to deleted node's right child

note that successor cannot have a left child as it contradicts the property that the successor is the min val in that subtree

## Hashing

Open Addressing

Properties:
1. h(key, i) enumerates all possible buckets
2. Every key is equally likely to be mapped to every permutation

(linear probing doesnâ€™t do this bc clusters have higher prob)

Still ok thanks to caching

Cost: O(1 / (1 - items/buckets))

Double Hashing

using another hash function to get the jump interval

h(k, i) = f(k) + ig(k) mod m

If g(k) must be relatively prime to m, prop 1 achieved

Quad probing

To terminate, n/m < 0.5 and mod prime num

Table Resizing

N = m -> m = 2m (grow) && n < m/4 -> m = m/2 (shrink)

Growing cost: O(old size + new size + no of elem)

## Heaps

Complete binary tree represented as an array

- root is at index 0
- parent index = (idx-1)/2
- left child index = 2*idx + 1
- right child index = 2*idx + 2

insertion:

1. insert new val at leaf
2. bubble up as needed

deletion:

1. swap top with leaf node
2. delete
3. bubble down as needed

heapify:

start at the bottom and call bubble each element down as needed - O(n) can be proven with Taylor series

intuition: want to minimise the distance we need to bubble the lower nodes (bc there are exponentially more nodes at the lower levels) hence bubbledown/siftdown is better than bubble/siftup

## All Pairs Shortest Paths (Floyd-Warshall)

Idea:
if you have the shortest path from i to j using vertices from {1, 2, ... k},
the shortest path from i to k using vertices from {1, 2, ... k+1} will be the min of the
* shortest path without using k+1
* shortest path from i to k+1 plus the shortest path from k+1 to j

code:
```python
# set up the dist matrix with the edge weights
# leave dist as inf for nodes that don't have a path yet
for k in range(nV):
	for i in range(nV):
		for j in range(nV):
			distance[i][j] = min(distance[i][j], distance[i][k] + distance[k][j])
```

## Knuth Morris Pratt (KMP) Pattern matching
Idea:
For each index `i` in the pattern, consider the subarray ending at `i`
Let `lps[i]` be the longest prefix that is also a suffix of that subarray

Now let `p1` be a pointer to the main string and `p2` be a pointer to our pattern.
When we get a mismatch, we now only need to make `p2` jump back to `lps[p2-1]`, because we know that `pattern[:that index]` will be the same as whatever we matched earlier in the main string (cause that's a suffix of `pattern[:p2]`.
Hence, we never have to move p1 backwards so time complexity = `O(len(string) + len(pattern))`

Code:
```python
def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
	lps = [0 for _ in range(len(needle))]
	ptr, prevlps = 1, 0
	while ptr < len(needle):
		if needle[ptr] == needle[prevlps]:
			prevlps += 1
			lps[ptr] = prevlps
			ptr += 1
		elif prevlps == 0:
			lps[ptr] = prevlps
			ptr += 1
		else:
			prevlps = lps[prevlps-1]
	
	ph, pn = 0, 0
	while ph < len(haystack):
		if needle[pn] == haystack[ph]:
			ph += 1
			pn += 1
		elif pn == 0:
			ph += 1
		else:
			pn = lps[pn-1]

		if pn == len(needle):
			return ph - len(needle)

	return -1
```

The first part can be extended to find the longest prefix in `word` that's a suffix in `target`
Technique (replace the $ with any character that's guaranteed to not appear in target): 
```python
genlps(word + '$' + target)
```
