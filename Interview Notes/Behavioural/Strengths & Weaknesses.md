## Strengths

Disciplined and focused

I am greatly inspired by the line, "Discipline equals freedom" from navy SEAL-turned bestselling author Jocko Willink. I believe that through self discipline, I can get stronger, faster, and more effective, and this in turn gives me the freedom to do the things I want to.

In my previous internship at RIL, SUTD, I was given extremely little supervision throughout the entire period. Things like deadlines or working hours were not strictly enforced onto me. Even so, I maintained my self discipline, showed up consistently, and put in the work, eventually completing my assigned projects almost a month before the end of my internship. Hence, I had time to help out and get involved with the other researchers' projects, earning their respect as well as giving me even more interesting experiences.

Flexible

I love helping and supporting my teammates, even if I need my step outside my comfort zone to fill in for what needs to be done. For example, in my Software Engineering module project, in order to help my team meet deadlines, I was involved in all parts of the project, including the frontend, backend, testing, and documentation. So far we have not missed a single project milestone.

Always seeking to improve

I am greatly influenced by the Japanese concept of kaizen - or continuous improvement. My goal for every single day is to become better than I was the day before. As such I am constantly trying to improve and I see every challenge and obstacle as a great opportunity to let me improve. During my summer holidays, I had to juggle an internship and a summer holiday project, and on top of that, I was preparing to compete in a BJJ tourney. Instead of getting overwhelmed and giving up, I took it as an opportunity to push my limits and reach a new level of productivity. I then focused on the day-to-day, trying to make a bit more progress on each task compared to the previous day. In the end, I was able to complete all my tasks.

## Weaknesses

Asking others for help

I tend to worry about whether I am being a bother when asking questions. As such, when I encounter problems, I would much rather spend extra time trying to figure out a solution on my own as opposed to looking to others for help. However, I understand that at times, especially in time-sensitive operations, it is necessary to just ask for help when needed to ensure efficiency. This is something that I have been working to improve recently during my Software Engineering project module in school. With the tight deadlines and the demands of other modules, I have been opening up more to my team members and approach them for help and/or clarifications when needed, focusing on ensuring my questions are clear and concise to minimise the work I generate for others.

Saying no to people

I naturally love helping others in need and will not hesitate to extend a helping hand when asked. However, at times I can be too much of a "pushover" and take on too many things, resulting in me being unable to invest my full effort into each person. However, recently when I was re-reading Jocko Willink's bestselling book Extreme Ownership, I was reminded of his line "Prioritise and Execute" . Since then, I have been working on applying this axiom to alleviate this weakness. For example, in my work as a Teaching Assistant in NUS, I often receive many requests for help from my students. Instead of trying to put in all my effort to address each and every one, I triage and prioritise the most important ones. For instance, I would put much more time into helping a student asking for help about a basic concept like recursion, as opposed to someone asking me about some specific function that could just be read from the documentation. Hence in this regard, I became more efficient and effective.
