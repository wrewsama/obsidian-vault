## Chapter 1: Weapons of Influence
fixed action patterns
- automatic sequence of behaviour in response to some trigger feature
- trigger feature is often a tiny aspect of the whole (e.g. instead of the baby chick itself, turkeys react to their chirping noise)
- examples for humans
	- giving some reason (even a dumb one) => compliance
	- high price => view product as "good"

contrast principle: if B is presented after A, and B is different from A, B will be _perceived_ as more different from A than it actually is

## Chapter 2: Reciprocation
- people feel naturally obligated to repay their debts
- can be used to trigger unfair exchanges (give an inch take a mile)
- reciprocal concessions
	- the obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us
	- works the same as anchoring from [[Never Split the Difference]]
- how to counter
	- mental shift: accept the 'gifts' for what they are (sales devices) and not as real gifts
	- understand that they are meant to make a profit off you, so there's nothing wrong with making a profit off them

## Chapter 3: Commitment and Consistency
- something like the exploitation of cognitive dissonance
- people are more likely to make a decision when it helps them justify a previous decision
- in other words, they become _committed_ to a _consistent_ view of something (so their current decision becomes consistent with their previous one, even if the current decision is much more significant)
- 2 main strategies
	- make them accept an innocuous request related to your true goal, then make your real request
	- add in a fake deal-sweetener to get their foot in the door, then take it away
- utilise the public eye by making the target's initial decision public. When one takes stand publicly, there arises a drive to maintain that stand for consistency
- how to counter:
	- ensure that your decision for doing something does not involve justifying your previous decision
