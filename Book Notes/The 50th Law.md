## Introduction

The 50th Law:
>The greatest feat people have is that of being themselves. They want to be 50 Cent or someone else. They do what everyone else does even if it doesn't fit where and who they are. But you get nowhere that way; Your energy is weak and no one pays attention to you. You're running away from the one thing that you own - what makes you different. I lost that feat. And once I felt the power that I had by showing the world I didn't care about being like other people, I could never go back. - 50 Cent

> It is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to dominate her you must beat her and batter her. - Niccolo Machiavelli

## Chapter 1: See Things for What They Are - Intense Realism
- A hard life is a blessing because danger forces you to focus intensely on what's going on around oneself
- **The greatest danger we face is the mind growing soft.**
- Today's world developed a taste for escapism. We must stay as realists and keen observers of the world around
- Exercises
	- Rediscover curiosity: Never stop your hunger for knowledge
	- Know the complete terrain: broaden your understanding of the world around
	- Dig to the roots: Find the root of every problem
	- See further ahead: set long term goals and see things based on whether or not they bring you closer to those goals
	- Look at people's deeds, not words: Everyone is playing to win, and they will use manipulation and deception to do it. Learn to understand their purpose behind each action
	- Reassess yourself: detach and assess what you did well and what you did poorly

## Chapter 2: Make Everything Your Own - Self-Reliance
- Your only real possessions that ever matter: your body, your time, your energy, your unique thoughts and ideas, and your autonomy
- Working for others = trading freedom for money
- Today's culture makes it too easy to make dependency a habit
- When people give you things or do you favours, **it is always with strings attached**
- What to do when working for others
	- Reclaim dead time
		- Treat your job like an apprenticeship, keenly observe and learn everything you can about the business
	- Create little empires
		- Take ownership of small parts (e.g. deprecated projects, new initiatives)
	- Move higher up the food chain
		- Understand that people are continually scheming to secure their own interests. Depending on them for advancement and protection will cause you to be let down or manipulated
		- Climb higher and eliminate your dependencies
	- Make your enterprise
		- Create something that reflects your individuality. Don't try to repeat or emulate others.

## Chapter 3: Turn Shit Into Sugar - Opportunism
- Every negative situation contains an opportunity
- Adopt an attitude opposite to most people
	- when things are going well, be concerned and vigilant
	- when things are going badly, become encouraged and fearless, then attack
- An opportunist in life sees all hindrances as instruments for power
- maximising opportunities:
	- look for turning points: inexplicable sudden success / failures, shifts in tastes or values, etc.
	- move before you are ready
