## Chapter 1
- hold no more stocks than you can remain informed on
- invest regularly
- ensure sales & earnings per share are increasing acceptably and that the price is reasonable
- consider the financial strength and debt structure to see if a few bad years will hinder the company's long-term progress
- understand the reasons for past sales growth => can judge likelihood of continuing past growth rates

## Chapter 2
- Know drops in the market are coming, be ready to ride it out, and when your favourite stocks go down, jump at the chance to buy more

## Chapter 3
- put as much of your money into stock funds as you can
- know what kind of funds you own
	- Capital appreciation: any kind of stock
	- Value: companies whose assets, not current earnings, are the main attraction
	- Quality growth: well established and expanding at a respectable, steady rate
	- Emerging growth: small companies
	- Special situations: companies where something unique happened to change their prospects
- divide your money among 3 or 4 types of stock funds
- when adding money to your portfolio, put it in the fund invested in the sector that's been lagging the market for several years
- don't constantly switch from one fund to another or try to predict future trends with past trends. Concentrate on solid performers and stick with those

## Chapter 5

## Chapter 7
- recessions will always end sooner or later, and in a beaten-down market there are bargains everywhere you look
- buy when stock price is at or below earnings line
- buying, selling and forgetting a long string of companies is not likely to succeed, it's better to stick to a manageable number of companies and learn how it behaves in recessions and what factors affect the earnings

## Chapter 8
- if you like the store, chances are you'll love the stock
- rule of thumb: stock should sell at or below its growth rate (e.g. a stock with a x% growth rate should have a p/e ratio <= x)
