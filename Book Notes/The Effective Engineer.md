## Chapter 1: Leverage
* $Leverage = \frac{Impact Produced}{Time Invested}$
- Increase your leverage
	- Reduce time taken to complete an activity
	- Increase the output (value/impact) of a particular activity
	- Switch to higher leverage activities
- Ensure your energy is directed towards real leverage points, not just easy wins. Some high-leverage activities require consistent, high amounts of time and effort, but have massive impact

## Chapter 2: Optimise for Learning

- Learning compounds over time
- What makes a work environment conducive for learning

	- Openness (information sharing, prioritisation, learning from failures)
	- Pace (iteration speed)
	- People
	- Autonomy
- Learning at work
	- Study core code from your company's best engineers
	- Write more code
	- Go through internal resources for technical / educational material
	- Master your core programming languages
	- Send code reviews to the harshest critics
	- Enroll in classes for targeted areas
	- Participate in design discussions
	- Work on a diversity of projects
	- Make sure you're on a team with some more senior engineers you can learn from
	- Don't fear code you don't know. Jump in anyway.
- Learning outside work
	- New languages and frameworks
	- Skills in high demand
	- Books
	- Discussion groups, talks, conferences, meetups, etc.
	- Build and maintain a strong network
