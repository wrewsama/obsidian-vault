- expectation gap
    - starting something new: explosive progress, assume that rewards always come that easily
    - that "flow state" eventually runs out and progress becomes slow and painful
    - solution: research the reality - what people actually needed to do to achieve your goal
        - e.g. How many years of experience do people need to reach rank X
- Be impatient with action, patient with results
    - in other words, focus on the _input_, which is what you _can_ control
    - the results will come when they come
- Know when to quit
    - are you learning valuable skills?
    - are you blocked on the same thing for more than 3 months?
    - **If you succeed, will you obtain something you want?**
