> When the fire hits, the people who decide promotions don't give them to the guy who's melting. They give them to the one who looks like he already put this same fire out six times before breakfast

- the Halo Effect: officers don't rank performance, they rank vibes
- It's not about how you look, it's about what you _leak_
    - people pick up on the little cues you show when you react to different things
    - from those things they observe, they come up with their own story about you
- People don't remember your best day, they remember how they felt sitting next to you on your worst
- Build your Halo through consistent effort in thousands of little actions - every message, every code review comment, etc. must exude calmness, especially when things go wrong
    - walk into every room knowing it's a courtroom, and everything you say is testimony
- On the flip side, just one slip-up breaks the Halo

> The ones who rise the fastest aren't always the ones who code the best. They're the ones who make the room feel safe just by walking in
