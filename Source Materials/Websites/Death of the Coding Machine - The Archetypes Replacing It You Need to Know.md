## Why the Coding Machine is dead
- The Coding Machine archetype is based on execution, committing more code than everyone else
- AI Coding made raw code output cheap

## What Matters Now
- _What_ to build
- _Whether_ the output is good
- tasks requiring high-level thinking, organisational context, or taste
- In short, **judgement**

## The 3 New Archetypes

#### Orchestrator
- architecture applied to the _process of building_, not just the product being built
- take a vague goal and turn it into a structured task graph to **delegate to agents** in parallel

#### Editor
- **curates output**, similar to a newspaper editor
- ingest massive amounts of raw AI output and find
    - edge cases
    - bugs
    - architectural decisions that won't scale

#### Multiplier
- **enable others** to ship better
- build infrastructure that makes AI useful across teams
    - shared workflows
    - evaluation frameworks
    - guardrails
