## Find Pain Points
- The Mom Test: If you ask your mom if your business idea is good, you'll get a nice answer, not a correct one
- The same is true if you ask for feedback directly
- Look for the pain points instead and focus your work on those

## Develop Useful Skills
- Once you've found the pain point, ask "What skill, when mastered, would permanently solve this class of problem"
- Also, find your "Effortless Skill" based on:
    - What problems you're attracted to
    - What activity gives your energy
    - What compliments do you brush off because they feel "easy"

## Make Your Hard Work Matter
- Connect your skills and a pain point, then your hard work will be amplified

## The Value Loop
**A one-off fix makes you helpful, a repeatable process makes you essential**
Process:
- Solve for one: find one person with a pain point, then use your skill to solve it thoroughly
- Generalise the Solution: turn it into a tool, template, or documented process that others can use
- Announce the product
