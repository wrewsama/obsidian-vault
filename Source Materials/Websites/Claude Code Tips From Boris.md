- spin up [[Git Worktrees]] with their own Claude Code sessions in parallel
- start complex tasks in plan mode
- keep `CLAUDE.md` updated. Claude is good at updating it by itself
- create skills (slash commands)
- point Claude at error logs (possibly through MCP) and ask it to fix
- prompt Claude by
    - providing detailed, unambiguous specs
    - asking it to implement an elegant solution
    - prove its implementation works
- use `/statusline` to add info (e.g. context usage, git branch) in the status line
- offload tasks to subagents (e.g. `use 5 subagents to explore the codebase`)
- use Claude for data and analytics, set up a skill for it
- enable "exploratory" or "learning" output style in `/config`
