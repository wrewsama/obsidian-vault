- theoretical vs physical blockers
    - don't declare yourself to be blocked until you've hit an actual error
    - if asking for permission to do something, say you're going to proceed unless someone has an issue, then proceed anyway
- don't slow down just because of uncertainty
    - proceed based on what is available
    - as things become clearer, make the appropriate adjustments
- don't be afraid to escalate if people aren't moving
    - **if you have a true blocker, you have authority**
    - keep escalating until
        - the problem is solved
        - some leadership says missing your deadline is okay
- start with the most unfamiliar thing
    - do research and prototypes
- work at a sustainable pace
