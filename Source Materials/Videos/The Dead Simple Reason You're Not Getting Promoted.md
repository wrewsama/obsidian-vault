Promotions are **TAKEN**, not given

- Make your intentions of promotions clear
    - tell your manager you want to get promoted
    - ask what you need to do to make it happen
    - to make the talk less direct, can ask about career growth / performance feedback instead
- Fight for more scope
    - Different levels are different games, you need the opportunity to play the next level, (obviously, you still need to be solid at your current one)
- Don't let others tell you to delay striving for your own promotion
