1. Document your accomplishments
    1. Create a text document (aka your brag document)
    2. Whenever you do something impactful, write it down in detail (especially quantitative results)
2. Get good (and stay good) at interviews (as the interviewer)
3. Know when to say "no"
    1. In general, say "no" 10x more than "yes"
    2. Only say yes to high impact activities (things you would want on your brag document)
