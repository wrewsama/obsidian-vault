## Chapter 1: Weapons of Influence
fixed action patterns
- automatic sequence of behaviour in response to some trigger feature
- trigger feature is often a tiny aspect of the whole (e.g. instead of the baby chick itself, turkeys react to their chirping noise)
- examples for humans
	- giving some reason (even a dumb one) => compliance
	- high price => view product as "good"

contrast principle: if B is presented after A, and B is different from A, B will be _perceived_ as more different from A than it actually is

## Chapter 2: Reciprocation
- people feel naturally obligated to repay their debts
- can be used to trigger unfair exchanges (give an inch take a mile)
- reciprocal concessions
	- the obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us
	- works the same as anchoring from [[Never Split the Difference]]
- how to counter
	- mental shift: accept the 'gifts' for what they are (sales devices) and not as real gifts
	- understand that they are meant to make a profit off you, so there's nothing wrong with making a profit off them

## Chapter 3: Commitment and Consistency
- something like the exploitation of cognitive dissonance
- people are more likely to make a decision when it helps them justify a previous decision
- in other words, they become _committed_ to a _consistent_ view of something (so their current decision becomes consistent with their previous one, even if the current decision is much more significant)
- 2 main strategies
	- make them accept an innocuous request related to your true goal, then make your real request
	- add in a fake deal-sweetener to get their foot in the door, then take it away
- utilise the public eye by making the target's initial decision public. When one takes stand publicly, there arises a drive to maintain that stand for consistency
- how to counter:
	- ensure that your decision for doing something does not involve justifying your previous decision

## Chapter 4: Social Proof
- people assume that an action is more correct if others are doing it
- the inverse is also true: people assume an action is incorrect if other people are actively choosing not to
- this effect is more powerful when the social proof is more similar to the target
- how to counter:
	- scrutinise the social proof to see if it is legitimate or engineered to influence you to do something

## Chapter 5: Liking
- obviously, we prefer to say yes to someone we like
- how they make us like them
	- using your actual friends as a proxy
	- physical attractiveness
	- similarity (style, backgrounds, interests, age, etc.)
	- compliments (one of the fundamentals in _How to Win Friends and Influence People_)
	- situations where you need to make contact in a cooperative setting
	- association (never be the bringer of bad news - _The 48 Laws of Power_)
- how to counter:
	- don't try to look for the ways they make you like them, many work subconsciously (e.g. attractiveness) 
	- be vigilant for when undue liking has been produced
	- ask yourself "have I come to like X more than I would have expected?"
	- if so, remain cognisant of that fact and focus on separating your feelings about the requester and request
	
## Chapter 6: Authority
- people are more likely to accept a request from someone they perceive to have authority over them, regardless of the request or the requestor
- how to create the illusion of authority
	- irrelevant authority (e.g. using a celebrity to promote a product's effectiveness)
	- titles
	- clothing
	- status symbols (e.g. jewelry, cars)
- how to counter
	- usually, authority is a good thing
	- the danger to be exploited is when the authority is fake or irrelevant
	- verify if that perceived "authority" is truly an expert in the relevant field

## Chapter 7: Scarcity
- opportunities seem more valuable when their availability is limited
- a sudden drop in availability is more effective than constant scarcity
- how to exploit:
	- limited available quantity
	- limited time
	- psychological reactance: when others try to stop you from doing something, that thing appears more desirable
	- introduce competition
- how to counter
	- notice any sudden rise in emotional arousal from scarcity influences
	- verify if the reason why you want something is because you want to _use_ it or only to _possess_ it
