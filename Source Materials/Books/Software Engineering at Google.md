## What is SWE
- $SWE = \int programming\ dt$
- SWE involves more time, scale, and trade-offs than simple programming
    - time: software that needs to be used over a long period of time will need to be subject to a lot of change
    - scale: if the cost of an operation grows superlinearly over time, it is not scalable
    - trade-offs: engineering decisions should be based on
        - we must (due to legal or customer requirements)
        - it's the best, based on the current evidence
> **Hyrum's Law**: With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviours of your system will be depended on by somebody
