## What is SWE
- $SWE = \int programming\ dt$
- SWE involves more time, scale, and trade-offs than simple programming
    - time: software that needs to be used over a long period of time will need to be subject to a lot of change
    - scale: if the cost of an operation grows superlinearly over time, it is not scalable
    - trade-offs: engineering decisions should be based on
        - we must (due to legal or customer requirements)
        - it's the best, based on the current evidence
> **Hyrum's Law**: With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviours of your system will be depended on by somebody

## How to work well in teams
>**The Genius Myth:** human tendency to ascribe success of a team to a single person
- Don't try to be the lone genius who does all the work by himself
- Share what you're working on with others 
    - get early feedback
    - ensure knowledge is well dispersed
- the 3 pillars of social interaction
    - humility
    - respect
    - trust
- Don't purposely contradict the system because of your ego, use it and learn how to adapt the system to your desires
- "Googleyness": Google's desirable personality traits
    - thrives in ambiguity
    - values feedback
    - challenges status quo
    - puts the user first
    - cares about the team
    - does the right thing

## How to lead a team
- lose the ego
    - trust in your team's competence
    - appreciate feedback and questions from team members
    - apologise when you've made a mistake
- be Zen
    - exude calm in all situations
    - respond to questions with questions: the person asking for help on a problem doesn't want you to solve the problem, just help them be able to solve it themselves
- be a catalyst
    - build consensus within the team
- remove roadblocks
- be a teacher and mentor
    - requirements: experience with team's systems, ability to explain, **ability to gauge how much help is needed**
    - the last one is the most important
- set clear goals
- be honest
-  track happiness
    - make sure team members get their deserved recognition and are happy with their work
