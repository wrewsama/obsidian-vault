## Craftsman Mindset VS Passion Mindset
- Don't try to follow your "passion"
- Career-related passions are extremely rare (only around 4% of all surveyed people's passions)
- Self-Determination Theory: motivation (passion) is a side effect of
    - autonomy
    - competence
    - relatedness (connection to others)
- The passion hypothesis can lead to overinflated expectations of your career, leading to discontentment and making you more likely to give up
- The _Craftsman Mindset_: focus entirely on becoming better - **so good they can't ignore you**
- adopt the _Craftsman Mindset_ and then passion will follow

## Career Capital
- Career Capital: rare and valuable skills that can be applied to a a career
- We trade career capital for careers that have the traits we desire (are passionate about)
    - e.g. Creative freedom, impact, control
- In general, what the career is doesn't matter, what matters is the accumulation of career capital
- 3 exceptions
    - no / few opportunities to develop rare and valuable skills
    - job has no positive impact on the world
    - job forces you to work with people you hate
