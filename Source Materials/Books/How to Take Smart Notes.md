## The Slip Box Workflow
- 2 slip boxes: one for references (i.e. source material), and one main one for collecting and generating ideas
- after reading, make brief notes about the content and store in the reference slip box
- after that, look at those notes and relate it to your own ideas. Write each of them down on separate notes and store in the main slip box
- reference other notes where appropriate

## Writing Workflow
- Make _fleeting notes_ to capture whatever pops into your mind
- Make _literature notes_ about the content you read
- Remember: **The accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.** Keep your mind open
- Make _permanent notes_ by looking through your fleeting and literature notes and relating them to your research, thinking, or interests
- Link it
    - related notes
    - some index
    - an 'entrypoint' note for a topic
- Look at the existing notes and further develop topics / projects
- Pick some topic and refine it
    - fill in gaps
    - remove redundant info
- Assemble and translate your notes into a rough draft
- Edit and proofread

## Four Underlying Principles
- Writing is the only thing that matters
    - Learning is demonstrated through writing
    - You need to practice it deliberately
    - Do everything as if nothing counts other than writing
- Simplicity is Paramount
    - 3 mistakes:
        - Too many permanent notes
        - Only collecting notes on a particular project
        - Treating all notes like fleeting ones
- Nobody ever starts from scratch
    - Don't just pick some topic to write and try to brainstorm ideas
    - Start with the notes you have and use that
- Let the work carry you forward
    - Writing notes in your own words while reading provides instant feedback on your understanding. This builds a feedback loop into your study workflow
    - It's easier to learn something when you know more related information 
        - Building a network of information (notes) makes it easier to absorb even more 

## Steps to Successful Writing
- Give each task your undivided attention, don't multitask
- Give the right kind of attention to each task: pure focus vs playful exploration
- Become an expert instead of a planner. Rely on embodied experience instead of a set of plans or rules
- Get closure on tasks. This avoids cluttering your short-term memory. Closure doesn't have to be the actual completion of the task, instead it can just be writing it down and postponing it for later
- Reduce decision fatigue

## How to Read
- Read with a pen in hand: take literature notes that serve to assist in the writing of permanent notes that add value to the slip box
- Keep an open mind: prioritise writing down ideas that go against your existing ideas and beliefs
- Get the Gist: Get good at extracting the important parts of your source material
- Learn to Read: Test yourself on the things you've read, don't just passively read
- Learn by reading: Write, take notes, and connect your ideas
