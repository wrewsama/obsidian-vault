## The Slip Box Workflow
- 2 slip boxes: one for references (i.e. source material), and one main one for collecting and generating ideas
- after reading, make brief notes about the content and store in the reference slip box
- after that, look at those notes and relate it to your own ideas. Write each of them down on separate notes and store in the main slip box
- reference other notes where appropriate

## Writing Workflow
- Make _fleeting notes_ to capture whatever pops into your mind
- Make _literature notes_ about the content you read
- Remember: **The accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.** Keep your mind open
- Make _permanent notes_ by looking through your fleeting and literature notes and relating them to your research, thinking, or interests
- Link it
    - related notes
    - some index
    - an 'entrypoint' note for a topic
- Look at the existing notes and further develop topics / projects
- Pick some topic and refine it
    - fill in gaps
    - remove redundant info
- Assemble and translate your notes into a rough draft
- Edit and proofread

## Four Underlying Principles
- Writing is the only thing that matters
    - Learning is demonstrated through writing
    - You need to practice it deliberately
    - Do everything as if nothing counts other than writing
