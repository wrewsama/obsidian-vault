## The Slip Box Workflow
- 2 slip boxes: one for references (i.e. source material), and one main one for collecting and generating ideas
- after reading, make brief notes about the content and store in the reference slip box
- after that, look at those notes and relate it to your own ideas. Write each of them down on separate notes and store in the main slip box
- reference other notes where appropriate
