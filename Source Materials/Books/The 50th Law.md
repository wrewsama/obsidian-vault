## Introduction

The 50th Law:
>The greatest fear people have is that of being themselves. They want to be 50 Cent or someone else. They do what everyone else does even if it doesn't fit where and who they are. But you get nowhere that way; Your energy is weak and no one pays attention to you. You're running away from the one thing that you own - what makes you different. I lost that fear. And once I felt the power that I had by showing the world I didn't care about being like other people, I could never go back. - 50 Cent

> It is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to dominate her you must beat her and batter her. - Niccolo Machiavelli

## Chapter 1: See Things for What They Are - Intense Realism
- A hard life is a blessing because danger forces you to focus intensely on what's going on around oneself
- **The greatest danger we face is the mind growing soft.**
- Today's world developed a taste for escapism. We must stay as realists and keen observers of the world around
- Exercises
	- Rediscover curiosity: Never stop your hunger for knowledge
	- Know the complete terrain: broaden your understanding of the world around
	- Dig to the roots: Find the root of every problem
	- See further ahead: set long term goals and see things based on whether or not they bring you closer to those goals
	- Look at people's deeds, not words: Everyone is playing to win, and they will use manipulation and deception to do it. Learn to understand their purpose behind each action
	- Reassess yourself: detach and assess what you did well and what you did poorly

## Chapter 2: Make Everything Your Own - Self-Reliance
- Your only real possessions that ever matter: your body, your time, your energy, your unique thoughts and ideas, and your autonomy
- Working for others = trading freedom for money
- Today's culture makes it too easy to make dependency a habit
- When people give you things or do you favours, **it is always with strings attached**
- What to do when working for others
	- Reclaim dead time
		- Treat your job like an apprenticeship, keenly observe and learn everything you can about the business
	- Create little empires
		- Take ownership of small parts (e.g. deprecated projects, new initiatives)
	- Move higher up the food chain
		- Understand that people are continually scheming to secure their own interests. Depending on them for advancement and protection will cause you to be let down or manipulated
		- Climb higher and eliminate your dependencies
	- Make your enterprise
		- Create something that reflects your individuality. Don't try to repeat or emulate others.

## Chapter 3: Turn Shit Into Sugar - Opportunism
- Every negative situation contains an opportunity
- Adopt an attitude opposite to most people
	- when things are going well, be concerned and vigilant
	- when things are going badly, become encouraged and fearless, then attack
- An opportunist in life sees all hindrances as instruments for power
- maximising opportunities:
	- look for turning points: inexplicable sudden success / failures, shifts in tastes or values, etc.
	- move before you are ready

## Chapter 4: Keep Moving - Calculated Momentum
- Don't try to control the chaos - flow with it and don't stop moving
- 4 types of flow
	- Mental flow
		- Don't compartmentalise your knowledge. When you learn something new, explore other related knowledge and keep your hunger for knowledge
	- Emotional flow
		- While you obviously shouldn't let your emotions control your actions, don't try to repress them either. Counterbalance, forget, and move past the feelings instead
	- Social flow
		- When working with others, provide a framework and let others help shape it instead of trying to control them
	- Cultural flow
		- As you get older, you tend to get locked in a style that is dead. You must periodically reinvent yourself

## Chapter 5: Know When to Be Bad - Aggression
- When you face people's indifference or hostility, you have to get aggressive and push them out of your way by any means necessary and not worry about some people disliking you
- People **will** take from you what they can. One who tries to be good will surely come to ruin among the many who are not good.
- The lion: aggressive, direct
- The fox: cunning, acts like a righteous lamb but makes crafty power moves behind the scenes
- Become a lion to deal with foxes and become a fox to counter lions
- Don't conform to others' arbitrary, unchanging rules
- If you cannot improve the relationship in any way, leave, create as much distance as possible, and regret nothing

## Chapter 6: Lead from the Front - Authority
- leaders must lead fearlessly and by example
- it is better to be feared than to be loved
- the 4 roles of a leader
	- the visionary
		- a group of any size must have goals and long term objects to function properly, chart the way to that goal
	- the unifier
		- force all factions in the group to unite under your leadership
	- the role model
		- develop a team of lieutenants with your ideas, spirit and values
	- the bold knight
		- it is human nature to want to slow down and become more conservative with a larger group. Do the opposite and become bolder

## Chapter 7: Know Your Environment from the Inside Out - Connection
- Think first of the audience, their changing needs and trends
- Don't see yourself as a separate group from your audience (even if you aren't actually using your own product / service)
- strategies
	- Crush all distance
	- Open informal channels of criticism and feedback
	- Reconnect with your base
		- People often become disconnected from their original audience after achieving success. Don't lose that connection
	- Create the social mirror
		- Use the feedback from others to adjust yourself, ignore your ego
## Chapter 8: Respect the Process - Mastery
- Fools want things fast and easy. But whatever they get is lost faster than they get it
- You must endure the hours of boredom and drudgery
- Do not separate work and pleasure. Your pleasure comes from the mental immersion of mastering the process.
- Strategies for developing the proper relationship to the process:
	- Progress through trial and error
	- Master something simple: pick one small part of your goal and devote yourself to mastering it first
	- Internalise the rules of the game: when you enter a new group, patiently observe and learn the rules that govern behaviour
	- Attune yourself to the details: Become immersed in the fine points of a project
	- Rediscover your natural persistence: 
		- Focus on a single thing at a time
		- Break things up into smaller chunks of time

## Chapter 9: Push Beyond Your Limits - Self-Belief
- Ask for more, aim high, and believe you are destined for something great
- Your opinion of yourself becomes reality - have high ambitions and a strong ego
- **The unpopularity of power and ambition comes from an unconscious desire to keep other people down**
- constantly reinvent yourself
- create a sense of destiny

## Chapter 10: Confront Your Mortality - The Sublime
- The most precious thing in life is its uncertainty - it could end at any time
- Embrace the fact that:
	- You have a limited amount of time to live
	- This time will inevitably involve pain and separation
- Convert your consciousness of death into something positive and active
- If attaining goals is your greatest source of pleasure, you will have purpose. When your death comes, you will have no regrets
