## Chapter 1: Creative is an Adjective, not a Noun

- Concepts must be created in our minds, before making them real. Only then do they exist.
- Accept that there are many things that you aren't even aware you don't know
- Instead of defending the little knowledge you have, embrace what you don't know and keep learning
- Creating requires effort. **Unless we make it happen, it never exists**
- A creative mind is an enquiring mind. Never stop questioning "why?"

## Chapter 2: Life is a zero-sum game
- Life is a zero-sum game. In order for someone to win, someone has to lose
- You must choose to be a predator, not the prey
- If you avoid that hard choice, it will be made for you
- You can have it all, but not all at once. Decide what is essential and focus on that

## Chapter 3: 90% of advertising doesn't work
- A simple lie is often more powerful than a complicated truth
- Don't give your targets the truth, give them what they want to believe is the truth
- Judge based on quality, not just on quantity
- See things from other perspectives
- Advertising isn't meant to sell things on its own, it's only meant to provide a competitive edge

## Chapter 4: You Can Run From It or You Can Learn From It
- Don't be afraid of rejection / failure
- Offset failures by increasing your inputs. More attempts => more successes
- Exploit failure as an opportunity for learning
- It's useless to care about failures out of your control, keep moving on 
- Use others' smug remarks about your failure as fuel for revenge

## Chapter 5: Less Really is More
- Humans tend to cluster options together, to reduce the number of choices
- The trick isn't to give more choices, it's to manage them effectively
- There is no right and wrong, only different perspectives
- Only use the words you absolutely need
- People only notice what's in their immediate consciousness. You need to engage them one-to-one

## Chapter 6: Taste is the Enemy of Creativity
- Creativity requires one to go beyond the fear of others' criticisms
- Get comfortable being uncomfortable
- If you trust an expert and they're wrong, it's still your fault for listening. Choose who you listen to wisely.
- Keep an open mind
- Stop trying to be liked

## Chapter 7: The Art of War
- Don't make threats you can't/won't follow through on
- Find people you can trust to do things, then trust them. If they fail, replace them.
- Don't just be involved, be committed
- Strategy vs tactics
    - strategists: focus on the big picture, the 'what'
    - tacticians: focus on execution, the 'how'
    - if you are naturally inclined towards tactics, find strategists to work with
- Overreliance on some new technology can easily become a weakness. Sometimes simple is best
- The details you pay attention to are potential areas where you can find a win

## Chapter 8: Form Follows Function
- Form is subjective
- Form is useless without function
- Figure out what the problem is, find something that solves it, only then can you worry about how 'perfect' things are
- make sure you're doing the right thing before worrying about doing it right

## Chapter 9: The Human Mind is Our Medium
- Imagination makes a great servant and a lousy master
- Question your own conspiracies and theories
- We see things not as they are, but as we are
