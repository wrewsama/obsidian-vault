## Chapter 1: Creative is an Adjective, not a Noun

- Concepts must be created in our minds, before making them real. Only then do they exist.
- Accept that there are many things that you aren't even aware you don't know
- Instead of defending the little knowledge you have, embrace what you don't know and keep learning
- Creating requires effort. **Unless we make it happen, it never exists**
- A creative mind is an enquiring mind. Never stop questioning "why?"
