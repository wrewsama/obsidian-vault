## The 5 Step Method
- CAPTURE unfinished work _outside_ your mind (so it's not _on your mind_)
- CLARIFY what the commitment is and what needs to be done for it
- ORGANISE them
- REFLECT on your current options
- ENGAGE with the chosen actions

## Capture
- use as few capture tools (e.g. notebooks) as possible and try not to change
- ensure you clear them regularly
## Clarify
- what the task is
- is it actionable
- what's the next action(s)
## Organise
- if not actionable
    - trash it
    - record it 
        - as something you "could do someday"
        - as reference material
- for multi-step projects, also record down the plan (specific actions) for that project
- if the next action can be done in < 2 min
    - do it immediately
- if the action takes > 2 min, either
    - delegate it
        - add it to a "waiting for" list
    - defer it
        - put it in a calendar
        - put it in a "next actions" list to be done ASAP

## Reflect
- review your
    - projects list
    - calendar
    - next actions list
    - waiting for list
- at least once a week
## Engage
- decide what to do based on the 4 criteria (in order)
    - context
    - time available
    - energy available
    - priority
