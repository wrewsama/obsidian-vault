## Chapter 1
- Manipulate the emotions first, then appeal to rationality
- negotiation = communication with results

## Chapter 2
- assumptions blind, hypotheses guide
- most people in negotiations are too preoccupied by their own arguments that they cannot listen attentively. Instead, you should focus entirely on understanding what the other person has to say
- slow it down. Focus on being a people mover instead of rushing to be a problem solver
- voice tones
	- late night FM DJ: downward inflections, calm, slow => authority and trustworthiness
	- positive/playful: relax and smile while talking => light and encouraging
	- direct / assertive: used only rarely
- mirrors
	- repeat the 3 last words or critical 1-3
	- encourages the other person to empathise and bond

## Chapter 3

- Tactical empathy: understand feelings and mindset, as well as what's behind them
- levels of emotion
	- presenting: the emotions you see and hear
	- underlying: the emotions motivating the behaviour
- labelling negative emotions diffuse them, labelling positive emotions reinforce them
- labels can be phrased as statements or questions beginning with _it seems / sounds / looks like_
- accusation audit (special form of labelling): open by listing every possible negative thing the other person can say about you

## Chapter 4
- Persuasion is about the other party convincing themselves that the solution **you** want is **their** own idea
- making the other person say "no" makes them feel safe and in control
- being pushed into a "yes" makes people defensive

## Chapter 5
- getting a "that's right" answer, as opposed to a simple "yes", indicates that the other person feels understood by you
- this can be done using a summary, preceded by mirrors and labels
- "you're right" is equivalent to a "yes". Insufficient.

## Chapter 6
- compromise is lose-lose. Never split the difference.
- use deadlines to make the other person rush
- manipulate the other person's idea of fairness
	- stating you just "want what's fair" => implies other person is being unfair
	- stating that you've already given a fair offer => implies other person has a wrong understanding of fairness
	- asking other person to let you know if they think they're being treated unfairly
- bend the person's reality
	- anchor their emotions / anchor and adjustment: set an extreme expectation, then frame your actual offer against that
	- let the other person go first (but be wary of their anchor)
	- establish a range
	- pivot to nonmonetary terms
	- if numbers are required, use odd, 'ugly' numbers => seems more thoughtful and thus immovable
	- surprise with a gift

## Chapter 7
- the listener is the one in control of the conversation
- don't try to force the other person into submission, give them the illusion of control
- use calibrated questions
	- starts with "how" or "what"
	- points the other person toward the problem in a non-confrontational way
	- work them towards your point of view using their energy
- "If you can't control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence the emotions of another party?"

## Chapter 8
- getting a "yes" is nothing without making them consider "how"
- identify the motivations of the others behind the table, find out how the deal affects everyone, not just your point of contact
- 7-38-55 rule: What makes us dislike someone: 7% words, 38% tone, 55% body language and face
- spotting a liar: they are more likely to use more words, and overuse third-person pronouns instead of first-person
- use your own name to build rapport
- avoid a fake "yes" with the Rule of Three - get them to agree 3 times
	- (first agreement)
	- summarise / label => lead them to a "that's right"
	- calibrated question about the implementation
- the multi-step "no" - 4 ways to express "No" before having to actually say it
	- "How am I supposed to do that"
	- "Your offer is very generous, I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for me."
	- "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that"
	- "I'm sorry, no"

## Chapter 9
- don't treat others the way you want to be treated. Treat them the way they need to be treated.
- be ready to tank the other person's extreme anchor
- strategic umbrage: wake the other person up to your problem
- "Why" questions: e.g. "why would you ever do `something you want them to do`": coaxes counterpart into working for you
- "I" messages: use the word "I" to set boundaries
- The other person is not the problem, the unsolved issue is
- Ackerman Bargaining
	- Set target price
	- offer 65%
	- go 85% > 95% > 100% (important point is that the increments are decreasing)
	- use empathy and multi-step "no" to get counteroffers from the other side between each step
	- on the final number, use a non-round number
	- throw in a nonmonetary item
	
## Chapter 10
- 3 types of leverage:
	- positive - the good things you can provide
	- negative - the bad things you can do
	- normative - the rules / morals the other person is bound by
- aim to negotiate face to face - makes it easier to uncover black swans
- Black Swans are usually revealed when something doesn't make sense or when the other person seems crazy
- do not fear conflict, embrace it and navigate it by listening and speaking clearly and empathetically

4. calibrated questions
