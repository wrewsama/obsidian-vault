## Chapter 1
- how Google hires SREs: 
    - standard SWE level
    - 85-99% of the required SWE level + relevant but rare skills
        - UNIX internals
        - networking (lower layers)
- at most half ops; at least half development
- purpose of SREs
    - maximise change velocity within the error budget
    - monitoring software that interprets data and alerts humans only when action is needed
    - emergency responses, automated as much as possible
    - preventing and addressing errors due to new changes
    - demand forecasting and provisioning resources
