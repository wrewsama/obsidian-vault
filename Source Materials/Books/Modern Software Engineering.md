## What is SWE
> The application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software
- SWE is more about designing solutions than producing them
- Precision and scalability > craftsmanship
- All engineering is about optimisation and trade-offs
- Foundations
    - Learning
    - Managing Complexity

## Optimising for Learning
- Iteration: repeating a sequence of operations to yield results closer to what's desired
    - need to make small changes that can be tested out (and removed) with minimal cost
- Feedback
    - provides evidence for a decision
    - the earlier the better
    - feedback for:
        - coding: tests, IDE tools
        - integration: CI
        - design (object-level): TDD can help with this
        - architecture (service-level): CD, generally with microservices
