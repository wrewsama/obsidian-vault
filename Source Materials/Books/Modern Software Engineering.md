## What is SWE
> The application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software
- SWE is more about designing solutions than producing them
- Precision and scalability > craftsmanship
- All engineering is about optimisation and trade-offs
- Foundations
    - Learning
    - Managing Complexity

## Optimising for Learning
- Iteration: repeating a sequence of operations to yield results closer to what's desired
    - need to make small changes that can be tested out (and removed) with minimal cost
