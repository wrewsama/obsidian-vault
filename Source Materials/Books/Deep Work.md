## Definitions
**Deep Work**
- professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration
- push cognitive abilities to their limit
- create value, improve skill, difficult to replicate
**Shallow Work**
- Cognitively easy
- performed while distracted
- not much value creation
**Deep Work Hypothesis**:
- The ability to perform deep work is becoming more rare and valuable

## The Idea
- Deep work lets you:
    - master hard things fast
    - produce with elite quality and speed
- Executives are the exception, not the rule. Only their role makes constant distractions from other people necessary. Plus, they can just hire people to do the deep work for them
- what you feel doesn't depend on what happens to you, it depends on what you focus on
- _we who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals_: any profession, when taken to the highest level of skill, has some sacred value
## The Rules
- Create a deep work ritual
    - Where you'll work
    - How long you'll work
    - Rules (e.g. no Internet, minimum input metric, etc.)
    - Support (e.g. coffee, light, food, etc.)
- Deep work can be collaborative. Collaborative deep work could be even better
- Guidelines
    - Prioritise only the most important tasks
    - Focus on input measures, not output
    - Track your hours
- Shutdown ritual: To end a workday and switch into rest mode
    - check task list for upcoming deadlines
    - plan for the next day
    - could incorporate physical or verbal cues too
- To avoid distractions during deep work slots, plan sessions dedicated for those distractions, then ensure you don't use them outside those planned sessions
- Productive meditation: while doing something not mentally challenging (e.g. walking, jogging), work on a single, well-defined problem, constantly bringing your attention back to that problem
- Memory training can help improve your ability to concentrate deeply
- Tool Selection: Find core metrics for your success and only adopt tools with a significant net benefit
- Don't search for quick and easy entertainment on the Internet, it makes you worse at focusing / deep working
- Create a fixed schedule with fine granularity (at least hourly)
- Evaluate the depth of every activity you have scheduled
- Work with your boss to limit the percentage of shallow work you have. 30-50% is best
- When replying to messages, think about the overall task the message is about, then execute the most efficient process to successfully complete it
- Make not replying your default response. Only reply when it's actually interesting or crucial
