## Definitions
**Deep Work**
- professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration
- push cognitive abilities to their limit
- create value, improve skill, difficult to replicate
**Shallow Work**
- Cognitively easy
- performed while distracted
- not much value creation
**Deep Work Hypothesis**:
- The ability to perform deep work is becoming more rare and valuable

## The Idea
- Deep work lets you:
    - master hard things fast
    - produce with elite quality and speed
- Executives are the exception, not the rule. Only their role makes constant distractions from other people necessary. Plus, they can just hire people to do the deep work for them
